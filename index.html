<p class="content">Wednesday is best known for her WWE career. She currently holds the World Title for Panther-like abilites (lightweight division). With her patented leaps, unmatched zoomies and devistating pounces, this champion seemed to be unstopable...until last year when her carrer took a tumble. Wednesday spent several weeks in the famous Catnip rehab facility: Feline Felons. This was after she was caught by authorities CatNippin' & Zoomin' underage. Some suspect the weight of her carrer lead to the substance abuse; her Manager had no comment on this speculation.</p>

    <p class="content" id="testP"> Quote: "Wednesday is a purrfect member of society-she regularly volunteers around her community by clawing furniture she deems unstylish and serving as a neighborhood alarm clock with her loud meows for food at the crack of dawn. I think that speaks to her character." - Rep. for Wednesday</p>
