    <p class="content">Wednesday Nyx Palumbo may appear to be purrfect for the legendary, well-loved role of Wednesday Addams on Netflix's <i>Wednesday</i> series with her shiny black coat, little toe beans, cutest teefers, soft meows, and snuggle-monster personality, but there is more than meets the cat eye with this fine feline!</p>

<p class="content">Wednesday is best known for her WWE career. Even years after her retirement, she still currently holds the world title for Panther-Like Abilities (lightweight division). She rose in rank due to her patented leaps, unmatched zoomies, and devastating pounces, and her devoted fans adored their champion in the height of her professional career. She was at the top of her game and seemed to be unstoppable... until last year, when her career took a knockout punch. Wednesday was caught by authorities CatNippin' & Zoomin' underage, a possibly career-ending offense, and spent several weeks in the famous catnip rehab facility, Feline Felons. Some suspect the weight of her wrestling career led to the substance abuse; her manager had no comment on this unfounded speculation.</p>

    <p class="content">"Wednesday is a purrfect member of society—she regularly volunteers around her community by clawing furniture she deems unstylish and serving as a neighborhood alarm clock with her loud meows for food at the crack of dawn. I think that speaks to her character more than a small stint in a respectable healthcare facility," said MC Skat Kat, Wednesday's manager, in an email to PurrFeed.</p>

    <p class="content">After Wednesday's brush with the law, she was back on the straight and narrow and used her hard-earned svelte and sculpted physique for a new passion—modeling. She was recruited by The Littered Catwalk Company and quickly became one of their most highly requested clients after her full-spread feature in Scratching Post Magazine, where she bared more than her nine lives and toe beans. Her modeling career has been on an unparalleled trajectory since: the media and paparazzi cannot get enough of Wednesday and her dark beauty, and it's her moody, mysterious—even naughty—look that many think led to her snagging the titular role on the Netflix series.</p>

        <p class="content">As Meow-llywood's hottest "it" cat, Wednesday's love life is the subject of daily blogs and hushed speculation. Rumors have her exchanging glances with infamous bad-boy Tom Cat, who roams her neighborhood streets on the prowl for pussycats. Despite Wednesday's mother's relentless efforts, Tom will not move in with the lovestruck Wednesday, and some days it seems like he wants nothing to do with her at all. This love affair has her acting out in risky ways, harkening back to the bare-all spread that made her a household name.</p>

<p class="content">All of this has us here at PurrFeed pondering life's greatest questions: "Why do the birds outside the window mock us?" "Was I fed in the past five minutes?" "Why does my human steal my poops?" We think Wednesday might have the answer to all of this and more with her meteoric rise to fame and world domination.</p>
